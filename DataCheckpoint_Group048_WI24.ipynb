    "The relationship between NBA players' salaries and their performance metrics has been a subject of interest among sports analysts, economists, and fans alike. Prior research has suggested that various factors, including player statistics, team success, market size, and even personal branding, can influence how much a player earns. However, the quantifiable performance metrics on the court often serve as a starting point for evaluating a player's worth.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, a study by Berri et al. (2007) found that traditional statistics such as points per game have a significant impact on NBA players' salaries, although these metrics may not always correlate with a player's contribution to team success<sup><a href=\"#Berri2007\">1</a></sup>. Another study by Groothuis and Hill (2004) suggested that while performance metrics are crucial, factors like player position and the role within the team also significantly affect salaries<sup><a href=\"#Groothuis2004\">2</a></sup>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, recent analyses have incorporated advanced metrics such as Player Efficiency Rating (PER) and Win Shares (WS) to assess a player's value more comprehensively. These advanced statistics aim to capture a player's overall impact on the game beyond traditional counting stats like points, rebounds, and assists. For example, Kahn (2006) highlighted the importance of these advanced metrics in determining players' salaries and pointed out that players contributing more to wins tend to earn higher salaries<sup><a href=\"#Kahn2006\">3</a></sup>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given this background, our hypothesis posits that specific statistics heavily influence NBA players' salaries at each position. We propose that assists per game could be a critical factor for point guards, given their role in orchestrating the offense. For shooting guards, the 3-point shooting efficiency might be more valued due to the emphasis on scoring from beyond the arc in modern basketball. Small forwards, being versatile players, could see their salaries most influenced by their overall scoring ability, measured by points per game. For power forwards, field-goal percentage might be paramount due to their role in scoring from inside and mid-range. Lastly, for centers, defensive metrics such as blocks per game and rebounds per game could be vital, reflecting their role in protecting the rim and controlling the boards.\n",

   "source": [
    "We hypothesize that for each NBA position, there is at minimum one feature that contributes heavily to a player's salary.\n",
    "\n",
    "For points guards, we believe that assist-per-game is the most important metric that helps to determine a player's salary. We rationalize this with the belief that since point guards are known for facilitating ball movement around the court, their ability to find other players to score baskets for them makes them valuable.\n",
    "\n",
    "For shooting guards, we think that 3-point-percentage, or the percentage of shots made from behind the 3-point line, is the most important metric that determines a player's salary. This is because the position is geared towards scoring as many points as possible, and teams would want someone who is efficient in their shots and able to score from many positions on the floor.\n",
    "\n",
    "For small forwards, we believe that their points-per-game is the most important metric in determining their salary. As the most versatile position on the floor, their overall scoring ability, from jumpshots to three-pointers, seems to be the most valued.\n",
    "\n",
    "For power forwards, we claim that their field-goal-percentage is the most important factor in their salary. Playing closer to the basket, power forwards are notable for taking many jumpshots closer to the basket than that of their guard teammates. As a result, efficiency in these closer-range shots is kept most notable as it shows their offensive prowess at closer range than a shooting guard.\n",
    "\n",
    "For centers, we believe that there are two metrics of equal importance: blocks-per-game and rebounds-per-game. Centers are known for being the tallest person on the floor and the most inclined to grab missed shots or block an opponent from scoring on their basket. As a result, both of these features are highly sought after from centers."

    "* In our research of NBA players' salaries and the contributing factors that affect them, we have several ethical considerations, including biases, privacy, and terms of use . Our datasets may carry biases, such as the representation and data collection methods. For example, they might disproportionately represent star players or those have larger markets, skewing  the analysis towards higher salaries and therefore overlooking players having smaller markets.  Furthermore, the method of data collection and historical context might embed systemic biases into the datasets, such as disparities in pay due to factors unrelated to performance. \n",
    "* To address these challenges, we plan to employ a comprehensive approach to identify potential biases in our datasets. This includes statistical analysis to uncover overrepresentation or underrepresentation of certain groups, cross-referencing data from multiple sources to validate findings, and conducting sensitivity analyses to understand the impact of potential biases on our conclusions. Throughout the research process, we will be careful for biases, continuously assessing our data and methods for any signs of inequity. We will carefully review the terms of use of each dataset to ensure compliance with its guidelines. Our analysis will focus on aggregated data to minimize privacy risks, and any sensitive or potentially identifiable information will be treated with extreme care. We also consider the ethical implications of our findings and how they are communicated to ensure that we do not inadvertently compromise player privacy or misrepresent data.\n",
    "* To ensure a fair analysis, we will strive to include a large variety of players in our research, taking into account variables such as position, tenure, and market size. This inclusivity helps reduce the risk of drawing conclusions that only reflect the experiences of the most visible or highest-paid players. By addressing these ethical issues, we aim to ensure that our research is responsible and produces insights that are not only valuable to understanding the NBA's salary dynamics, but also respect the privacy of the players represented in our dataset."
