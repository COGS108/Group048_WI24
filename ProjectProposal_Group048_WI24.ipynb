    "Since the 1990s, a massive shift in professional basketball has taken place. Watching an NBA game now versus watching a game from the 90s is like watching two different sports, as the game has evolved in so many ways. There have been new rules that have been implemented regarding defenses, offense, and even an overall shift in how players approach the game. The upper echelon of talent in the NBA will always make a huge salary, but what about everyone else? Getting on to an NBA roster is extremely difficult, only tenths of a percent of basketball players will ever play in the NBA, and those who do have to earn their contracts, and that is typically done by their performance on the court. With the evolving game, different things are valued more and less now versus how they were back then. For example, a big man in the 90s plays completely different and even has a completely different skillset than a big man in the modern version of the game.\n",

    "This study will seek to answer our research question, how have the deciding factors of an NBA player's salary changed over time? To answer this question, we will examine previous research that has been done, and also look at statistics from the 2023-2024 season and player's salaries, as well as previous seasons. For example, A study found on gigasheet <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) compiiles player statistics from 2022-2023 and their respective salaries. Another factor is the expanding salary cap, as the league has generated record levels of revenue in recent years, and thus player's can earn more. A study from The Hoops Geek <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) examines NBA salaries and the salary cap from the 1990s til present day. Finally, Hoops Reference<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-3) is a staple in the basketball community for any basketball statistics, and will be used to answer our question.\n",
