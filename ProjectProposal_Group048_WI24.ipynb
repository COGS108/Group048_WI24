    "Since the 1990s, a massive shift in professional basketball has taken place. Watching an NBA game now versus watching a game from the 90s is like watching two different sports, as the game has evolved in so many ways. There have been new rules that have been implemented regarding defenses, offense, and even an overall shift in how players approach the game. The upper echelon of talent in the NBA will always make a huge salary, but what about everyone else? Getting on to an NBA roster is extremely difficult, only tenths of a percent of basketball players will ever play in the NBA, and those who do have to earn their contracts, and that is typically done by their performance on the court. With the evolving game, different things are valued more and less now versus how they were back then. For example, a big man in the 90s plays completely different and even has a completely different skillset than a big man in the modern version of the game.\n",

    "This study will seek to answer our research question, how have the deciding factors of an NBA player's salary changed over time? To answer this question, we will examine previous research that has been done, and also look at statistics from the 2023-2024 season and player's salaries, as well as previous seasons. For example, A study found on gigasheet <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) compiiles player statistics from 2022-2023 and their respective salaries. Another factor is the expanding salary cap, as the league has generated record levels of revenue in recent years, and thus player's can earn more. A study from The Hoops Geek <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) examines NBA salaries and the salary cap from the 1990s til present day. Finally, Hoops Reference<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-3) is a staple in the basketball community for any basketball statistics, and will be used to answer our question.\n",

    "We predict that there is a change in the statistics that influence how much a player will be paid. The modern version of the NBA has placed a large emphasis on jump shooting, specifically from the 3 point line, and we predict that this is a major contributing factor to how much players are paid now, versus how it was not as important back in the 90s, when jumpshots and three pointers were more likely to be seen as \"bad shots.\" Our prediction is that players who are more efficient and shoot a higher volume of three pointers are more likely to earn a higher salary."

    "\n",
    "ANSWER: Our ideal dataset would have tabular data in a clean or easily-cleaned form, indexing by player's salary for a given year and containing variables (Columns) with detailed information on shot-statistics (like 3-pointers per game, 2-pointers per game, attempted 3 pointer shots per game, attemped 2 pointer shots per game, etc.), and also game presence (how long were they on court, passes made/received, blocks, assists, etc.). The data for these two types of data will give us the opportunity to do a thorough investigation on our hypothesis or even perhaps come to a different conclusion. \n",

    "* In our research of NBA players' salaries and the contributing factors that affect them, we have several ethical considerations, including biases, privacy, and terms of use . Our datasets may carry biases, such as the representation and data collection methods. For example, they might disproportionately represent star players or those have larger markets, skewing  the analysis towards higher salaries and therefore overlooking players having smaller markets.  Furthermore, the method of data collection and historical context might embed systemic biases into the datasets, such as disparities in pay due to factors unrelated to performance. \n",
    "* To address these challenges, we plan to employ a comprehensive approach to identify potential biases in our datasets. This includes statistical analysis to uncover overrepresentation or underrepresentation of certain groups, cross-referencing data from multiple sources to validate findings, and conducting sensitivity analyses to understand the impact of potential biases on our conclusions. Throughout the research process, we will be careful for biases, continuously assessing our data and methods for any signs of inequity. We will carefully review the terms of use of each dataset to ensure compliance with its guidelines. Our analysis will focus on aggregated data to minimize privacy risks, and any sensitive or potentially identifiable information will be treated with extreme care. We also consider the ethical implications of our findings and how they are communicated to ensure that we do not inadvertently compromise player privacy or misrepresent data.\n",
    "* To ensure a fair analysis, we will strive to include a large variety of players in our research, taking into account variables such as position, tenure, and market size. This inclusivity helps reduce the risk of drawing conclusions that only reflect the experiences of the most visible or highest-paid players. By addressing these ethical issues, we aim to ensure that our research is responsible and produces insights that are not only valuable to understanding the NBA's salary dynamics, but also respect the privacy of the players represented in our dataset."
